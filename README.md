# Set up
Install Python 3.11 (necessary)

- Open a new cmd window
- Go into the directory where the "Machine_Learning_Model" folder is located
  example 'cd  I:\School Project\mario AI image recognition\Machine_Learning_Model'
- Download the required Libraries using the requirements.txt file
  'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- run the main.py file using 'python main.py'


DISCLAIMER: The AI currently uses the 100% clearance rate qTable. To start a new Training model simply delete the qTable or move it to a different location to save it.
		- When starting a new Training Model you can optionally replace its content with '[]' to get accurate coherent data
	    Adding to that, the qTable currently, why ever the fuck, has a chance to just corrupt when leaving the training. The qTable therefore is saved periodically.
	    Same issue occurs with the "score_graph.json" file, which is not as bad. Simply delete its content and leave an empty array '[]'
